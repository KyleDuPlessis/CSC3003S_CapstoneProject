# CSC3003S_CapstoneProject
CSC3003S Capstone Project (2018)
----
Overview:
----
In the second semester of their third year all students majoring in computer science undertake a three-person capstone project focussing on delivering a working prototype system designed and implemented according to established software engineering techniques in object-oriented programming. CSC3003S project groups working under the same supervisor (playing the role of client) tackle the same project. The programming language can be determined by the client/supervisor. All groups doing a particular project have to use the same object-oriented language. The capstone project is about software engineering (not research). The project forms the high point and final application of the studentsâ€™ undergraduate learning of computer science and software engineering.

Project selected:
----
A tool for managing research outputs - CBIB (Prof. Tommie Meyer <tmeyer@cs.uct.ac.za>)
The Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) is a virtual centre, hosted at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and with nodes at a number of South African universities. The goal of this project is to create a web-based tool for managing the research outputs produced by CAIR members. The tool should enable users to:
- add, modify, and delete entries corresponding to research outputs;
- search entries based on various criteria;
- produce various reports based on the stored information.
This functionality should be provided with appropriate levels of security built in.
